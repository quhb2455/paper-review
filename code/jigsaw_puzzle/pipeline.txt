pipeline

1. we resize each input image until either the height or the width matches 256 pixels and preserve the original aspect ratio.
	=> w, h 중 작은 값을 기준으로 resize
	ex) w= 300 h= 400 => w=256 h=256*(400/300)
	
2. we crop a random region from the resized image of size 225 × 225
3. split it into a 3 × 3 grid of 75 × 75 pixels tiles.
4. extract a 64 × 64 region from each tile by introducing random shifts ==> random crop 말하는 듯
5. feed them to the network

- Color jitter
1. crop the central square of the original image and resize it to 255 × 255
2. train the network with both color and grayscale images. Our training set is a composition of grayscale and color images with a ratio of 30% to 70%
3. jitter the color channels of the color images of each tile randomly by ±0, ±1, ±2 pixels
